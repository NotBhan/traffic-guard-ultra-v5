🚦 Project Title

Smart Adaptive Traffic Management System with Simulation & Live Mode

📌 Problem Statement

Traditional traffic signal systems work on static timing, which leads to:

Unnecessary congestion

Increased waiting time

Fuel wastage

Poor handling of emergency vehicles

There is a need for an intelligent traffic management system that can dynamically adjust signal timing based on real-time vehicle density and support low-cost simulation for demonstration purposes.

🎯 Project Objective

Static signal timing ko vehicle count–based dynamic timing me convert karna

Real-time traffic density ke according green signal allocation

Low CPU/GPU usage ke sath efficient processing

Admin panel ke through monitoring & control

Simulation + Normal working mode dono support karna

Hardware (Arduino + LEDs) ke through real signal demonstration

💡 Proposed Solution

Ek smart traffic management system jo:

Camera/video feed se vehicles count karta hai

Har signal green hone se 5 seconds pehle final vehicle count lock karta hai

Traffic density ke basis par green time allocate karta hai

Emergency, night mode, manual override jaise features support karta hai

Simulation mode me hardware LEDs + relay ke through demo deta hai

🛠️ Final Tech Stack (Optimized & Lightweight)
🔹 Backend

Python

Flask (lightweight web framework)

OpenCV (camera & video processing)

Background Subtraction (vehicle presence)

Optional YOLO Nano (limited usage)

🔹 Frontend (Admin Panel)

HTML (Jinja2 Templates)

CSS (tailwind via CDN)

Vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API)

MJPEG video streaming

🔹 Hardware (Simulation Mode)

Arduino UNO

4-Channel Relay Module

Red, Yellow, Green LEDs

USB Serial Communication (pyserial)

🔹 Database

❌ No database used

All processing done in-memory for low overhead

❓ Why These Technologies Are Used
Why Flask?

Lightweight

Less RAM & CPU usage

Easy MJPEG streaming

Perfect for real-time systems

Why No React?

React causes unnecessary overhead

Live video + frequent updates = performance drop

HTML + JS is faster & more stable

Why No Database?

Real-time decision making needed

Data persistence not required for demo

Reduces complexity and bugs

Why Arduino?

Real traffic signal simulation

Hardware + software integration

Strong impression in college demo
